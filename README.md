# Password Generator Project

This project consists of an HTML-based password generator application with three main functionalities: creating a password, generating a random password, and returning to the home page. The project is structured into three HTML files (`createPassword.html`, `generatePassword.html`, and `index.html`), each serving a specific purpose. Additionally, there is a shared CSS file (`index.css`) and JavaScript files (`index.js`, `function.js`, `homePage.js`, `createPassword.js`, `generatePassword.js`) providing the functionality for each page.
